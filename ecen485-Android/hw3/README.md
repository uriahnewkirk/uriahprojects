Homework #2 (for reference): 
<br />
You are to design a GUI with the following elements: <br /> <br />
    Two buttons <br />
    At least two check boxes <br />
    3 Radio buttons <br />
    A set (at least 3) of labels <br /> <br />
Your labels will be updated based on user interaction. For example, a click of one checkbox will cause a label to say "True", while the click of the other checkbox will cause it to say "false".
Similar types of actions will be done based on the buttons and radio buttons.
<br />
<br />
Homework #3:
<br />
This homework builds on the last homework. Read over the different types of attributes that can be set for the labels. Have the different buttons, radio buttons, and check boxes correspond to some attribute for the labels. For example, the radio buttons could be used to specify one of three fonts, while the check boxes specify bold or italics. Be creative. Part of your grade will be based on your originality.
