COMP 350
Spring 2017
Second Programming Assignment:

1. Implement the Ballroom Dancers simulation discussed on slides 26-28 in the Semaphores powerpoint.

Input:

./a.out n m output.txt

where n is the number of "leaders" and m is the number of "followers" and output.txt is the output file generated by
your program.

Output:

leader <tid> dances with follower <tid>

for all threads...

Note, the number of leaders and followers may be different.

We want to make sure all dancers dance at least once. After all have dance, the program ends.

Hint: keep a running count of how many followers have danced and leaders have danced.

Name your program: dance.cpp and place it in your pgm directory. If a binary semaphore is required, use a posix mutex instead.
