Assignment:
<br />
Write a pthread program to determine the vertex or vetices with the
maximum degree. Your program should use concurrency to sum each row of the given adjacency 
matrix, and then calculate the degree for each vertex. Find the vertex
or vertices with the maximum. You should only use concurrency to find
the degrees of each of the vertices. The rest should of the program 
should be done sequentially.
