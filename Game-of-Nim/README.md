Project for COMP 165 class 
<br />
"Write a program to play the simple two player game of Nim. Nim starts with a pile of stones. We will assume there are 15 stones in the pile at the beginning. Players alternate turns taking 1, 2, or 3 stones from the pile. The player that takes the last stone from the pile loses. Your program should allow the user to play against the computer. Your computer program should win all the time!"
