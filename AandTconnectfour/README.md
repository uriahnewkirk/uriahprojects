  For this project, I worked in a team of 3 alongside Jenaye Minter & Curtez Murvin to create an application by the end of the semester for our software engineering course. The instructions were quite ambiguuous and we were open to create any type of application that we wanted. Based on feedback from previous students who took the class, we decided to go with something simple and fun like the game connect 4 along with a GUI. In this repository is all of the source code for the prototype we were able to create. You can also see a video demonstration [here](https://youtu.be/vlvO1N86kFg).
